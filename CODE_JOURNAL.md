## NextJS

To create the feedback app frontend I decided to go with NextJS mostly for experience/practice purposes. Most of the time I work with CRA apps, so this is a good opportunity to take a closer look at what NextJS offers.

## UI Components library

To build this app I don't want to re-invent the wheel, so I'm basically looking for a UI Component library that provides those basic building blocks I need to build my application.
For this time I'm choosing [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), it seems pretty solid, easy to customize, nice documentations, good community, fun to work with.
Other options I was considering were:
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) I definitely need to try this one in the future. Docs seem easy to follow and complete, components offer the very basic but with powerful customization options. Downside is that it doesn't have some core components (as of 2021/11/09) such as Button/Select.
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) A known old one. MUI offers a tremendous amount of components that are highly customizable, great documentation and a solid community. I'm not choosing it this time because I have already worked with it in the past (*But not with 5.x.x version which is the latest version right now*) and I just want to try something different.
